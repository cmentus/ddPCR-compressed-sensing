# Compressed Sensing Applications to Droplet Digital PCR (and other assays)

## Matlab Compressed sensing code:
*Requirements:* Matlab, [CVX package](http://cvxr.com/cvx/)
Here you will find

* Code for simulating compressed sensing on synthetic data representing populations of any size, prevalence and viral concentration for positive samples in this [directory](/PoissonCS)

* Pooling designs/sensing matrices in this [directory](/PoissonCS/pool_mats). We analyze matrices from the following projects because they represent classes of good deterministic expanders.
